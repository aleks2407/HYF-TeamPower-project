    <h3>What Do We Do With Branches On GitHub</h3>
    <p>You always create a branch from an existing branch. Typically, you might create a branch from the master branch of your repository. You can then work on this new branch in isolation from changes that other people are making to the repository. A branch you create to build a feature is commonly referred to as a feature branch or topic branch.</p>
